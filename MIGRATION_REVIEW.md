# Language to Languoid Migration Review

## Executive Summary

The migration from the `language` table to the `languoid` table and related tables has been **largely completed** with good attention to backward compatibility. Most phases are implemented correctly, but there are a few gaps and potential issues to address.

**Overall Status**: ✅ **85% Complete** - Core functionality is in place, but some edge cases and sync rule optimizations need attention.

---

## Phase-by-Phase Review

### ✅ Phase 1: Database Migration - COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ **Fully Implemented**

The migration file (`supabase/migrations/20251113120000_add_languoid_references.sql`) is comprehensive:

- ✅ Creates languoid records for unmatched languages (60+ languages)
- ✅ Sets `ui_ready=true` for matched languoids based on language.ui_ready
- ✅ Creates `languoid_source` records for ISO 639-3 codes
- ✅ Sets `creator_id` from language.creator_id
- ✅ Updates `find_matching_languoid()` function with proper priority logic
- ✅ Handles all three reference points: profile, project_language_link, asset_content_link

**Notes**: The migration is well-structured and idempotent. The deterministic ID generation (`lang-${uuid}`) ensures consistency.

---

### ⚠️ Phase 2: Sync Rules Updates - MOSTLY COMPLETE

**Status**: ⚠️ **Needs Review**

**What's Working**:
- ✅ Global bucket syncs `ui_ready=true` languoids
- ✅ User profile bucket syncs languoids via `download_profiles`
- ✅ All related tables are synced (languoid_alias, languoid_source, languoid_property, languoid_region, region, region_alias, region_source, region_property)

**Issues Found**:

1. **Missing Profile Languoid Sync**: The sync rules don't explicitly sync the user's profile languoid when `profile.ui_languoid_id` is set. Currently, languoids are only synced via `download_profiles`, but a user's UI languoid might not be in their download_profiles.

   **Recommendation**: Add a sync rule to ensure the user's profile languoid is synced:
   ```yaml
   - SELECT * FROM "languoid" WHERE id = (SELECT ui_languoid_id FROM "profile" WHERE id = bucket.profile_id)
   ```

2. **Language Table Still Synced**: The sync rules still include:
   ```yaml
   - SELECT * FROM "language" WHERE bucket.profile_id in download_profiles
   ```
   This is fine for backward compatibility, but should be documented as deprecated.

**Recommendation**: Add explicit sync for user's profile languoid to ensure UI language selection works offline.

### ✅ Phase 3: Drizzle Schema Updates - COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ **Fully Implemented**

**Verified**:
- ✅ All languoid table definitions exist in `drizzleSchemaColumns.ts`:
  - `createLanguoidTable()`
  - `createLanguoidAliasTable()`
  - `createLanguoidSourceTable()`
  - `createLanguoidPropertyTable()`
  - `createRegionTable()`
  - `createRegionAliasTable()`
  - `createRegionSourceTable()`
  - `createRegionPropertyTable()`
  - `createLanguoidRegionTable()`

- ✅ Tables exported in all three schema files:
  - `db/drizzleSchema.ts` (merged tables)
  - `db/drizzleSchemaSynced.ts` (synced tables)
  - `db/drizzleSchemaLocal.ts` (local tables)

- ✅ Relations properly defined:
  - profile ↔ languoid (via ui_languoid_id)
  - project_language_link ↔ languoid (via languoid_id)
  - asset_content_link ↔ languoid (via languoid_id)
  - languoid ↔ languoid_alias, languoid_source, languoid_region ↔ region

- ✅ Column additions verified:
  - `profile.ui_languoid_id` ✅
  - `project_language_link.languoid_id` ✅
  - `asset_content_link.languoid_id` ✅

**Excellent**: The schema structure is clean and follows the existing patterns.

---

### ✅ Phase 4: Hooks Migration - COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ **Fully Implemented**

**Verified**:
- ✅ `hooks/db/useLanguoids.ts` created with all required hooks:
  - `useLanguoids()` ✅
  - `useUIReadyLanguoids()` ✅
  - `useLanguoidById()` ✅
  - `useLanguoidNames()` ✅
  - `getLanguoidById()` ✅ (standalone function)

- ✅ `hooks/useLocalization.ts` updated:
  - ✅ Queries languoid table instead of language
  - ✅ Uses `languoid.name` for SupportedLanguage mapping
  - ✅ Proper fallback to `ui_language_id` for backward compatibility
  - ✅ Mapping function handles: English, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Tok Pisin, Standard Indonesian

- ✅ `hooks/useQuestDownloadDiscovery.ts` updated:
  - ✅ Discovers languoid IDs from `project_language_link.languoid_id`
  - ✅ Discovers languoid IDs from `asset_content_link.languoid_id`
  - ✅ Discovers related records (aliases, sources, properties, regions)
  - ✅ Still tracks `languageIds` for backward compatibility

Quest offload (and `useQuestOffloadVerification`) has been removed, so there is no offload path that needs languoid verification.

- ✅ Used in recording services for asset creation

**Excellent**: The offline creation flow is well-designed and handles edge cases properly.

---

### ✅ Phase 11: Constants and Utilities - COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ **Complete** (No changes needed)

The plan mentioned checking constants and utilities, but no specific changes were required. The existing structure supports the migration.

---

### ⚠️ Phase 12: Documentation - PARTIAL

**Status**: ⚠️ **Needs Improvement**

**Found**:
- ✅ Deprecation notices in `useLanguoids.ts`
- ✅ Comments in migration file
- ✅ Backward compatibility notes in code

**Missing**:
- ⚠️ No comprehensive migration guide for developers
- ⚠️ No documentation of breaking changes
- ⚠️ No documentation of new offline language creation flow
- ⚠️ No documentation of languoid alias display logic

**Recommendation**: Create a `MIGRATION_NOTES.md` file documenting:
- How to use the new languoid system
- Backward compatibility guarantees
- Offline creation flow
- Sync behavior

---

## Critical Issues

### 🔴 Issue 1: Profile Languoid Sync Missing

**Severity**: Medium  
**Impact**: Users' UI language might not sync properly if their profile languoid isn't in download_profiles

**Location**: `supabase/config/sync-rules.yml`

**Fix**: Add explicit sync for user's profile languoid:
```yaml
- SELECT * FROM "languoid" WHERE id = (SELECT ui_languoid_id FROM "profile" WHERE id = bucket.profile_id)
```

---

### 🟡 Issue 2: Missing Documentation

**Severity**: Low  
**Impact**: Future developers might not understand the migration or how to use languoids

**Fix**: Create comprehensive migration documentation

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Add Profile Languoid Sync Rule**: Ensure users' UI languoids sync properly

### Medium Priority

2. **Documentation**: Create migration guide and usage documentation
3. **Testing**: Add tests for offline languoid creation flow
4. **Deprecation Warnings**: Add console warnings when deprecated language table is used

### Low Priority

5. **Cleanup**: Consider removing language table sync once migration is complete
6. **Performance**: Review sync rules for optimization opportunities

---

## Backward Compatibility Assessment

✅ **Excellent**: The migration maintains strong backward compatibility:

- All old fields (`ui_language_id`, `source_language_id`, `language_id`) are still supported
- Fallback logic is implemented throughout
- Old language table queries still work
- Migration is non-breaking for existing data

---

## Overall Assessment

**Grade**: A- (85%)

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive migration covering all major areas
- Strong backward compatibility
- Well-structured code following existing patterns
- Good offline support
- Proper error handling

**Weaknesses**:
- Missing profile languoid sync rule
- Lack of comprehensive documentation

**Conclusion**: The migration is production-ready with minor fixes needed. The core functionality is solid, and the backward compatibility approach is excellent. Address the critical issues before full deployment.
