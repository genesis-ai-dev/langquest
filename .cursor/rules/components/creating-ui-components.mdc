## Methodology

Use the [Composition Pattern](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/composition).

## Icons

When looking for a suitable icon, use the lucide-icons MCP.

## Implementation Notes

- Always import icons from `lucide-react-native` using the suffix `Icon` ex. `MailIcon`, `BellIcon` not `Mail` or `Bell`.

- Don't use margin (`m-*` properties in tailwind), use views with flex (`flex`), flex gap `gap-*`, and `flex-[row|col]`.

- Don't concatenate tailwind classnames with template strings, always use the `cn` utility in `utils/styleUtils.ts`.

- **React 19**: Don't use `React.forwardRef` anymore. In React 19, components can accept `ref` as a regular prop directly. Simply add `ref` to your component's props interface and use it directly.
