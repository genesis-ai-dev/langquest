# Animation Guidelines

Learnings from Emil Kowalski's UI animation blog posts.

## Keep Animations Fast

- Default to use `ease-out` for most animations.
- Animations should never be longer than 1s (unless it's illustrative), most of them should be under 500ms.
- Release/exit animations should be faster than enter animations (e.g., 200ms exit vs 300ms enter).

## Easing Rules

- Don't use built-in CSS easings unless it's `ease` or `linear`.
- Use the following custom easing curves for a polished feel:

```css
/* Standard ease-out - good default for most animations */
--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);

/* Smooth ease-in-out for symmetrical animations */
--ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1);

/* Snappy ease for quick feedback */
--ease-snappy: cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1);

/* Spring-like bounce */
--ease-spring: cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1);
```

## Button Press Feedback

Always add a subtle scale-down effect on button press for immediate feedback:

```css
.button {
  transition: transform 160ms ease-out;
}

.button:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
}
```

This makes the UI feel responsive and "listening" to the user.

## Never Scale From Zero

Don't animate from `scale(0)` - it feels abrupt and unnatural. Start from a slightly larger scale:

```css
/* Bad */
@keyframes appear {
  from {
    transform: scale(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}

/* Good */
@keyframes appear {
  from {
    transform: scale(0.9);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    transform: scale(1);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

## Origin-Aware Animations

Set `transform-origin` to match the trigger point. Dropdowns should expand from the button that triggers them:

```css
/* Dropdown triggered from a button on the right */
.dropdown {
  transform-origin: top right;
}

/* Popover appearing from bottom center */
.popover {
  transform-origin: bottom center;
}
```

## Tooltip Timing

- Add a delay (300-500ms) for the first tooltip to prevent accidental activation
- Subsequent tooltips should appear instantly while the user is exploring
- This prevents tooltip "flickering" when users move their mouse across the UI

## The Magic of Clip Path

Use `clip-path` for smooth reveal animations. It's hardware-accelerated and doesn't affect layout:

```css
/* Hide from right, reveal from left */
.overlay {
  clip-path: inset(0px 100% 0px 0px); /* Hidden */
  transition: clip-path 200ms ease-out;
}

.overlay.revealed {
  clip-path: inset(0px 0px 0px 0px); /* Visible */
}
```

### Hold to Delete Pattern

Create a confirmation interaction using clip-path:

```jsx
<button className="button">
  {/* Colored overlay revealed on hold */}
  <div aria-hidden="true" className="hold-overlay">
    <TrashIcon />
    Hold to Delete
  </div>
  {/* Default content */}
  <TrashIcon />
  Hold to Delete
</button>
```

```css
.button {
  position: relative;
  transition: transform 160ms ease-out;
}

.button:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
}

.hold-overlay {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  clip-path: inset(0px 100% 0px 0px);
  transition: clip-path 200ms ease-out; /* Fast release */
  background: var(--destructive);
  color: white;
}

.button:active .hold-overlay {
  clip-path: inset(0px 0px 0px 0px);
  transition: clip-path 2s linear; /* Slow fill on hold */
}
```

## CSS Transforms Best Practices

- Transforms are GPU-accelerated and don't trigger layout recalculation
- Prefer `transform` over `top`/`left`/`width`/`height` for animations
- Combine transforms in a single property: `transform: translateX(10px) scale(0.95) rotate(2deg)`
- Order matters: transforms are applied right to left

## Drawer Component Tips

- Use `transform: translateX()` or `translateY()` for slide animations
- Add a backdrop with fade animation
- Handle swipe-to-dismiss with velocity detection
- Snap to open/closed states based on drag distance and velocity

## Toast Component Tips

- Stack multiple toasts with staggered positioning
- Use enter animations from the edge of the screen
- Exit animations should be faster than enter
- Consider hover-to-pause auto-dismiss behavior

## Developing Taste

1. **Surround yourself with great work** - Follow designers, study apps you admire
2. **Analyze, don't just appreciate** - Ask "why does this feel good?"
3. **Practice deliberately** - Recreate animations you like
4. **Share publicly** - Get feedback and iterate

## Good vs Great Animations

| Good              | Great                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Generic easing    | Custom easing curves             |
| Center origin     | Origin-aware (from trigger)      |
| Same speed in/out | Fast exit, slower enter          |
| Abrupt start/end  | Smooth acceleration              |
| Single property   | Orchestrated multiple properties |

## Spring-Based Animations

For interactive elements, spring physics feel more natural than duration-based animations:

- Springs respond to velocity (dragging fast = more bounce)
- No fixed duration - they settle naturally
- Use libraries like Motion (Framer Motion) or React Native Reanimated for spring animations

## Performance Tips

- Use `will-change` sparingly and only on elements about to animate
- Prefer `opacity` and `transform` - they're composited on the GPU
- Avoid animating `width`, `height`, `padding`, `margin` - they cause layout thrash
- Use `clip-path` for reveal effects instead of changing dimensions
