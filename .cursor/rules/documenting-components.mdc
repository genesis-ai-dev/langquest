## Documentation Structure

When documenting components, follow the [components.build documentation standards](https://www.components.build/docs). Every component should include these sections:

### 1. Overview

Begin with a concise introduction that explains:

- Component's purpose
- Appropriate usage scenarios
- When to use vs. when not to use

### 2. Demo, Source Code, and Preview

Provide:

- **Interactive demo** showcasing the component in action
- **Source code** used to create the demo
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Consider tabbed interfaces to switch between demo and code without cluttering

### 3. Installation

Offer clear installation instructions:

- Single command users can copy-paste
- Multiple installation methods if applicable (npm, registry CLI, etc.)
- Example:
  ```bash
  npm install <component-name>
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  npx shadcn@latest add <component-url>
  ```

### 4. Features

Highlight key features to help users quickly understand capabilities:

- **Customizable** – Easily adjust styles, sizes, and behavior
- **Accessible by default** – Keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, screen reader support
- **Composable** – Works seamlessly with other components and patterns
- **Type-safe** – Comprehensive TypeScript types for safety and autocomplete
- **Theming support** – Integrates with design tokens or theme system
- **Lightweight** – Minimal dependencies and optimized for performance
- **SSR/SSG ready** – Works with server-side and static rendering frameworks
- **Well-documented** – Clear usage examples and API reference

Tailor this list to your specific component, emphasizing what makes it unique.

### 5. Examples

Demonstrate flexibility with practical examples:

- **Variants** – Different visual styles or sizes available
- **States** – Loading, disabled, error, or success states
- **Advanced Usage** – Complex scenarios and edge cases
- **Composition** – How component works with other components
- **Responsive Behavior** – Adaptation to different screen sizes

Each example should include:

- Rendered output (visual preview)
- Corresponding code
- Brief explanation of what the example demonstrates

### 6. Props and API Reference

Document all available props, methods, and configuration options:

For each prop, include:

- **Name** – The prop identifier
- **Type** – TypeScript type definition
- **Default** – Default value if not specified
- **Required** – Whether the prop is mandatory
- **Description** – What the prop does and when to use it

Consider:

- Grouping related props together
- Highlighting commonly used props
- Using auto-generated type tables if available (e.g., Fumadocs Auto Type Table)

### 7. Accessibility

Detail how component supports accessibility features:

- **Keyboard navigation patterns** – Document all keyboard interactions
- **ARIA attributes and roles** – List all ARIA attributes used and their purposes
- **Screen reader support** – Describe how component works with screen readers
- **Focus management** – Explain focus behavior (initial focus, focus trapping, focus return)
- **Color contrast** – Ensure and document sufficient contrast ratios

Include:

- Keyboard map (which keys do what)
- ARIA roles and states used
- Focus management behavior
- Screen reader announcements

### 8. Changelog and Versioning

Maintain a changelog on each component documentation page covering:

- **Version numbers** following semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **New features and enhancements**
- **Bug fixes**
- **Breaking changes** – Clearly marked with migration guides
- **Migration guides** – Step-by-step instructions for major version updates

Help users understand:

- What changed between versions
- How to upgrade safely
- Code examples showing before/after patterns for breaking changes

## Documentation Best Practices

### Keep Documentation Current

- Update docs when code changes
- Sync examples with actual implementation
- Remove deprecated examples

### Use Real-World Examples

- Solve actual problems developers face
- Show common use cases
- Include edge cases and gotchas

### Provide Troubleshooting

- Include common pitfalls
- Document known limitations
- Provide troubleshooting tips
- Link to related issues or discussions

### Performance Considerations

- Document performance characteristics when relevant
- Mention optimization opportunities
- Note any performance trade-offs

### Link Related Content

- Link to related components
- Reference patterns that use this component
- Link to design system tokens used
- Cross-reference accessibility guidelines

### Make Examples Runnable

- All code examples should be runnable
- Test examples regularly
- Ensure examples work with latest versions
- Provide complete, copy-pasteable examples

### Code Quality in Examples

- Use consistent code style
- Follow project conventions
- Include proper error handling
- Show best practices

## Documentation Format

### Code Blocks

- Use syntax highlighting
- Include copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Show complete, working examples
- Add comments explaining non-obvious parts

### Visual Examples

- Include screenshots or rendered output
- Show component in different states
- Demonstrate responsive behavior
- Use consistent visual style

### Interactive Demos

- Provide live, editable demos when possible
- Allow users to modify props and see results
- Show component behavior in real-time
- Include multiple scenarios in one demo
